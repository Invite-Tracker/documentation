Welcome to Invite Tracker's documentation. Here you may learn a thing or two about the bot.

## Introduction

Invite Tracker is a powerful Discord bot that offers countless features such as invite and message tracking, giveaways, and much more. It is also capable of welcoming new users to your server with a fully customizable join message feature.

::: info
Invite Tracker also offers an advanced web dashboard that makes the bot configuration more intuitive and easier. Check it out [here](https://invite-tracker.com).

More information on how to use the dashboard can be found [here](/dashboard/).

## Getting Started

Firstly, make sure that Invite Tracker is in the server you are looking to use it in. If not, you may invite it by clicking [here](https://invite.invite-tracker.com/).

Invite Tracker by default only asks for the permissions required for it to work. We highly recommend that you make sure you are inviting it with the required permissions. Otherwise, the bot may not work properly. If you want to know more details about why we are asking for specific permissions, read the [FAQ](/faq).

## Configuration

Once Invite Tracker has been invited to your server, if you invited it with the required permissions, it will already begin tracking new invites!

If you want to jump right into having Invite Tracker announce new members, you should check out Invite Tracker's [join, join DM, and leave message](/dashboard/messages/) features.
