The bot profile plugin allows you to customize how the Invite Tracker bot (or your custom bot) appears in your server. This includes setting a custom avatar, banner, nickname, and bio.

## Overview

Bot profile customization lets you personalize how Invite Tracker presents itself in your server. This is especially useful for:

- Matching the bot's appearance to your server's theme
- Creating a more branded experience
- Making the bot feel more integrated with your community

## Accessing Bot Profile Settings

1. Navigate to your server's dashboard
2. Select **Bot Profile** from the plugins menu
3. Customize the available options

## Customization Options

### Avatar

Upload a custom profile picture for the bot that will be displayed in your server. This avatar appears in:

- The bot's profile when clicked
- Message author icons (in some contexts)
- Server member lists

::: info
The avatar should be a square image for best results. Recommended size is 512x512 pixels or larger.
:::

**To set a custom avatar:**

1. Click the avatar upload area
2. Select an image file from your device
3. Preview the result
4. Click **Save Changes**

### Banner

Set a custom banner image that appears on the bot's profile in your server.

::: info
Banners are displayed at the top of the bot's profile popup. Recommended aspect ratio is 16:9.
:::

**To set a custom banner:**

1. Click the banner upload area
2. Select an image file from your device
3. Preview the result
4. Click **Save Changes**

### Nickname

Set a custom nickname for the bot in your server. This changes how the bot's name appears in:

- The server member list
- Message author names
- Mentions and references

::: tip
Choose a nickname that fits your server's theme while still being recognizable as your invite tracking bot.
:::

### Bio / About Me

Write a custom description for the bot that appears in its profile. The bio can be up to **2000 characters** and supports Discord markdown formatting.

**Ideas for your bio:**

- Describe what the bot does in your server
- Include links to your server's rules or help channels
- Add personality that matches your community

## Removing Customizations

To remove any customization:

1. Navigate to the respective setting
2. Click the remove/delete button
3. Save your changes

The bot will revert to its default appearance for that setting.

## Custom Bot Tier

If you have the **Custom Bot** tier subscription, you have even more control:

- Your custom bot application itself can be branded
- Set the bot's global avatar and username via the Discord Developer Portal
- Custom embed colors for all bot messages
- Custom status and activity text

See the [Custom Bot](/dashboard/custom-bot) documentation for more details on Custom Bot tier features.

## Best Practices

1. **Use high-quality images** - Low-resolution images may appear blurry
2. **Match your server theme** - Consistent branding creates a better experience
3. **Keep the bio informative** - Help members understand what the bot does
4. **Test your changes** - View the bot's profile after saving to ensure everything looks correct

::: warning
Changes may take a few moments to propagate across Discord. If you don't see your changes immediately, wait a minute and refresh.
